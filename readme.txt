Replacing the standard WordPress commenting form with custom HTML/JavaScript code.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can easily replace the standard **WordPress** commenting form with one of the popular commenting system's widget, such as  [**Disqus**](https://disqus.com/) and [**HyperComments**](https://www.hypercomments.com/) or with the **VKontakte** comments widget.

= Working with plugin =
* After installation you should go to the plugin settings page in the ***Comments*** section and paste the comments widget into a single form field and then click ***Save Changes***.
* To get the widget code you will need to register at the appropriate commenting system's website (or create a simple application for **VKontakte**).
* You can add to the widget code any custom HTML markup.
* Any custom text or HTML/JavaScript code will be displayed instead of the standard **WordPress** comments.
* Just leave the field empty to hide the comments on all pages.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin through the **WordPress** installer or copy the plugin's files into your site's */wp-content/plugins/* folder and then activate it via the control panel.
